## Getting Started

Create a folder named "counter-vanilla" and drop the following two attached files into the folder:
- `index.html`
- `package.json`

Update the version of the packages:

```JSON
// https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/core?activeTab=versions
// https://www.npmjs.com/package/parcel?activeTab=versions

  "dependencies": {
    "@babel/core": "7.23.9",
    "parcel": "2.11.0"  // `parcel-bundler` is deprecated.
  }
```

With `counter-vanilla` as the current directory, run `npm install`.

Then in the project root, add a `.gitignore` to include `node_modules/`.
